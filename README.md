# Tic Tac Mine!

## Description

This is my first React App. It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game themed around the popular game Minecraft. I made this app following this [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) from the official React website. The game has an AI that plays against you, and you can choose between 4 different difficulties (Peaceful, Easy, Normal and Hard) for the AI to play. The AI uses the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to decide its next move.

## Preview

You can play the game [here](https://tic-tac-mine.vercel.app/).
